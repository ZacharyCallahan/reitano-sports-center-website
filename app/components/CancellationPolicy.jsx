            <h1>Cancellation/Rescheduling Policy</h1>
            <p>For All basketball and baseball small group sessions and 1:1 sessions there will be NO refunds, make up days,
                or credits issued for cancellation/no shows! You are holding a spot that would otherwise be filled. If you need to
                reschedule a small group session or a 1:1 session and give at least a 24 hrs notice, there will be a $5 fee that
                must be paid prior to you being rescheduled. If a rescheduling request is made less than 24 hrs in advance, there
                will be a $10 fee prior to being rescheduled. For any of our group services such as Monthly Skills Clinic, Offense
                Clinic, Shooting Clinic, Mini Ballers Skills Sessions, or any of the like, no refunds, make up days, or credits will
                be issued for any missed days regardless of the reason. All days and times are posted when signing up for any of our
                events. If you cannot attend all the days of any event we offer prorated fees if space allows. For prorated fees you
                MUST contact Tasha @ 740-808-3924 PRIOR to registration and you will be added to the event and sent an invoice.

                When added to any event or training sessions (small group or 1:1) per customer request instead of doing through website
                ALL invoices MUST BE paid within 24 hrs of booking. Otherwise your spot is not secure and will become available for someone else to fill.

                THANK YOU</p>
